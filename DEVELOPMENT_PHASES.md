# Suggested Development Phases

## Week 1-2:

- ``System Design``: Define the architecture of the system, including truck and bin agents, communication protocols, and environmental elements (e.g., traffic and road conditions).

- ``Initial Setup``: Implement a basic waste collection simulation with a few truck and bin agents operating independently.

## Week 3:

- ``Agent Communication``: Implement the communication protocols between truck agents and bin agents. Truck agents should receive fill level reports from bin agents and make collection decisions based on the information received.

- ``Route Planning``: Develop an initial route-planning algorithm that enables truck agents to travel between bins and the central depot while managing their fuel or battery levels.

## Week 4:

- ``Dynamic Adaptation``: Introduce environmental changes like roadblocks or varying traffic conditions that affect the agents' routes. Agents should adjust their routes dynamically in response to these changes.

- ``Task Allocation Protocol``: Implement a task allocation or collaboration mechanism (e.g., Contract Net Protocol) that allows truck agents to hand off tasks or divide collection areas efficiently.

## Week 5:

- ``Resource Optimization``: Enhance agentsâ€™ decision-making algorithms to optimize resource usage, including minimizing fuel consumption and maximizing waste collection per trip.

- ``Fault Tolerance``: Implement fault-tolerant behavior in the system. If a truck agent fails or becomes unavailable, the system should redistribute its tasks to other agents.

## Week 6:

- ``User Interface and Visualization``: Create a simple interface that shows the city layout, truck movements, bin statuses, and key metrics (e.g., waste collected, fuel consumed). The interface should allow users to observe agent behavior in real time.

- ``Testing and Evaluation``: Test the system with various city layouts and dynamic conditions, such as varying waste production levels and traffic. Measure system performance using the predefined optimization metrics.
